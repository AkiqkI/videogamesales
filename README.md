# 🎮 Video Game Sales Forecasting

In this project, I analyzed historical video game sales data to identify the key factors that influence commercial success. Acting as a data analyst at *Ice* (an online video game store), my task was to simulate a real-world scenario in December 2016 and help plan advertising strategies for 2017.

## ✅ Key Accomplishments

- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Explored the dataset in-depth to detect structural issues, understand value distributions, and prepare for statistical testing.

- 📅 **Defined Timeframe for Analysis**  
  Focused the analysis on recent data to ensure relevance for forecasting.

- 📊 **Data Visualization**  
  Created multiple intuitive charts to highlight genre trends, platform dominance, and regional preferences.

- 🧪 **Statistical Testing**  
  Used hypothesis testing to assess the significance of platform and genre on user ratings and game sales.

- 📌 **Actionable Conclusions**  
  Identified that critic scores and game genre were stronger predictors of sales than platform alone. Found notable regional distinctions in player preferences (e.g., Nintendo success in Japan vs. PS dominance in North America).

- 🧠 **Strategic Implications**  
  Recommended focusing on growing platforms, popular and consistent-performing genres, and culturally aligned content for future campaigns.
